**Title: User Authentication Methods**

User authentication is a cornerstone of digital security, verifying an individual's identity before granting access to systems or data. Several methods exist, each offering different balances between security, usability, and cost.

The most common method is the **username and password**. Its primary advantage lies in user familiarity and ease of implementation. However, passwords are vulnerable to theft, guessing, and reuse across multiple sites, making them inherently weak when used alone. They are suitable for low-risk applications but often insufficient for sensitive data.

**Biometric authentication** leverages unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial features, or iris patterns. Biometrics offer high convenience as users don't need to remember passwords or carry physical tokens. Their uniqueness also provides strong security *if* implemented correctly. Disadvantages include privacy concerns regarding the storage of sensitive biometric data, potential for false positives/negatives, the need for specific hardware (scanners, cameras), and the fact that compromised biometric data cannot be changed like a password. Common scenarios include mobile device unlocking and physical access control.  



**Authentication tokens** provide another layer of security. These can be physical hardware devices generating One-Time Passwords (OTP) or software applications on smartphones. Tokens offer robust protection against password theft as the code is dynamic and short-lived. The main drawback is the need for the user to possess and manage the token (physical or software). Tokens are frequently used in corporate environments and financial services, often as part of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Ultimately, the choice of authentication method depends on the specific security requirements, user convenience tolerance, and context. Increasingly, systems employ MFA, combining two or more methods (e.g., password + token) to provide layered, more resilient security against unauthorized access.
