Distinguished professors, it's a great honor for me to be here for this interview.

My name is yaowenda, and I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in cyberspace security from Northeast Petroleum University. I'd like to introduce myself in the following three aspects.

First, I am a dedicated student with outstanding academic performance, and I rank second in my major with an average score of 92.75 (ninety-two point seven five). I've also been awarded the National Scholarship and the first-class academic scholarship. I also have a keen interest in English study and keep improving my academic English capacity, and have passed the CET6 test with a score of 530. These accomplishments have equipped me with a firm foundation for my future postgraduate studies.

Second, I have great passion and potential for research, with more than one year's experience of scientific research in lab. In the second year in college, I joined the research team, read some papers and re-implemented some classical models. In the third in college, I began to focus on the field of deepfake face detection. I wrote a survey paper by reviewing 120 articles on this topic. In this paper, I categorized the detection methods from both image and video perspectives, and summarized their core principles, pros and cons, and use cases. Notably, my survey was the first in this field to summarize methods for detecting faces forged by diffusion models. In addition to this theoretical work, I also implemented an improved Transformer-based model for face forgery detection and built a detection platform based on it. These experiences have provided me with extensive theoretical knowledge and hands-on research capabilities in deep learning and computer vision.

Third, I also participate in contests in various disciplines, including cybersecurity competitions, mathematical contest in modeling and English competitions, and have won a national prize, a provincial prize and lots of university-level awards. I've learned a lot from these experiences and have further enhanced my individual working abilities and teamwork skills.

Northeast Petroleum University is my alma mater. I love the academic atmosphere here and currently have great interest in geological science. If I could be offered this precious opportunity, I will forge ahead and get more achievements under the guidance of excellent instructors.

That's all for my introduction, thank you.
